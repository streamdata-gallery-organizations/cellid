description: CellID was the result of the need to know where we are without using
  a GPS signal. You can define it as a positions seeker of the antennass identifiers
  belonging to the mobile operators. This is possible thanks to the support, direct
  and indirect, on some databases, which have been populated with datas in all the
  world, with high accuracy to say the least. These databases are always in constant
  update on the evolution of the telephone operators, but even so it is possible that
  at times some informations are still missing.
